## Introduction to Objects

**What is an Object?**

Generally, an object is anything that occupies space in the universe.

For example: The room you are sitting in contains several objects. The laptop you are working on is an object, the table you have kept your laptop on is an object. The chair on which you are sitting is also an object.

**Classes & Objects**

A class can be defined as a blueprint or description of objects that can be created from it. We have also observed the following properties of a class:

- NOT REAL: Class is not a REAL THING; itâ€™s just a concept, actually the objects created from a class are real.
- A single class can be used to create any number of instances or objects.


## Software Development Process

**Problem Solving Process**

Let us discuss the steps that are followed in general to solve any problem.

- First, we focus on the requirements of the problem.
- Next, on the basis of understanding of requirements, we develop a design or prototype of the solution.
- Finally, we convert the prototype to the real implementation and deliver it to the customer.

**Software Development Process**

We saw the general problem-solving process which consist of 4 steps:
- Requirement Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Delivery


The same set of steps is followed to develop any software. The only difference is that here implementation is the coding phase.

## Introduction to UML (Unified Modelling Language)

**Why UML?**

Suppose there are two designers Alice and Bob creating designs of different parts of the software.
Now if Alice follows some conventions and Bob follows other conventions, then it becomes very difficult for Tom, the developer, to code these designs correctly.

There should be some standard that must be followed by Alice and Bob, so that their designs are uniform, and seems unambiguous to TOM.

Here comes to the rescue, the UML i.e., Unified Modelling Language.

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a standard graphical language for modeling object-oriented software.
It was developed by three software engineers, James Rumbaugh, Grady Booch, and Ivar Jacobson.

**UML Diagrams**

As UML is a graphical language, it supports two types of diagrams that can be classified as Structural and Behavioral.

The structural Diagrams are used to create a static model of the software. That is, it gives an idea about what all components build up the system.

The Behavioral Diagrams are used to create a dynamic model of the software. It tells how the different components or modules interact with each other.

## Class Diagram and Object Diagram

**Class Diagrams**

In the real world, if you observe, you can see that all the objects have some properties as well as functionalities.

For example: a fan has properties such as color, type, no_of_blades, and made. With these attributes it also has some functionalities such as start(), stop(), increase_speed(), decrease_speed().

**A class diagram in the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a type of structural diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the System's Classes, their Attributes, Operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.**

In a class diagram a class is represented with the help of a rectangular box having three partitions:
- The first partition contains the class name.
- The second partition contains all the attributes of the class.
- The third partition contains all the functionalities of the class.
