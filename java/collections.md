# Collection frameworks

Array is preferable when we have to store a lot of data let's say roll numbers of student in a class. We can create and access an array to store roll numbers of let's say 100 students in a class like below:

`int[] rollNumber = new int[100];
int len = rollNumber.length;
for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
  System.out.println(rollNumber[i]);
}`
