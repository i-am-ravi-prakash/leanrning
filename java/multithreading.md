## Introduction

- Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously.
- A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing.

If multiple processes are being executed simulatneously, it's called multi-processing. Let's say, I am working on my MacBook. I am playing my favourite song on it, and also working on some file. And alongwith these works, Mac OS is also downloading some file from internet.
